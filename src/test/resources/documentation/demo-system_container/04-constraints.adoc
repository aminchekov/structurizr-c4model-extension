[small]

This section provides a list of the environmental constraints imposed on the development of the System (timescales, budget, technology, team size/skills, etc).

=== Budget
Since there is no formal budget for this application,
there is a constraint to use free and open source technologies for the development. Ideally, the website should run on a single server with the cheapest hosting costs.
